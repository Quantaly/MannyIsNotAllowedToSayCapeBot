Now:
 - Don't work on #spirit (where cape talk goes) or #spam (where everything goes)

Soon:
 - Make README.md not suck
 - Add XML/JSON with member/channel id numbers
 - Give bot profile image

Later:
 - Fun stuff??

Indeterminate:
 - Better detection than "is 'cape' a substring." e.g. "escape," "caape"
   ~ regex: /\bc\s*a+\s*p\s*e/i
   
// will probably reorganize this soon

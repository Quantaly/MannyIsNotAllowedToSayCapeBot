For 1.1:
 - Make README.md not suck
 - Make profile image for bot
 - Better detection than "is 'cape' a substring." e.g. "escape," "caape"
   ~ regex: /\bc\s*a+\s*p\s*e/i
 - Leave message for first-time offenders
 
Later:
 - Fun stuff??
   ~ Respond to triggering DM's with ("Say that again, to my face. >:(") and if the user sends it 5(?) times, say ("Look, it's not my fault I only have one response template!")

# MannyIsNotAllowedToSayCapeBot
This is a bot made for FRC Team 5892's Discord server. At one point, there was a heated debate about whether or not our team should wear capes as part of our spirit outfit, which ended against capes due to safety concerns. One pro-cape member of the team started spamming the word "cape" in every channel, leading to the need for a moderation bot.
### Features
- Deletes messages with the word "cape" in them.

It doesn't do a whole lot, but it's good at what it does!
